                             <p align="justify"><b>Abstract:</b> The deceleration of transistor feature size scaling has
                                 motivated a growing adoption of specialized accelerators, such as GPUs, FPGAs and
                                 ASICs, and more recently new types of computing such as neuromorphic and quantum. There
                                 is a tension between specialization and generalization, former
                                 enabling raw performance improvement and latter enabling standard software stacks. This
                                 talk will address System Software functionality for memristor-
                                 based accelerators by exploring one accelerator implementation (the Dot Product Engine,
                                 or DPE) for a select pattern of applications in machine learning
                                 and neural networks. It will also describe a new instruction set architecture and
                                 accompanying software stack and toolchain, with its compiler, loader,
                                 device driver and emulators. Measurements of performance and power consumption will
                                 demonstrate that making an accelerator such as the DPE more
                                 generalized can lead to a broader adoption and better utilization.

                                 <p align="justify"><b>Abstract:</b> To develop agent-embedded robots with MI
                                     (Machine Intelligence), iOA (intelligence operating architecture) needs to
                                     be designed for sensing, thinking and action. The key modules of iOA are the
                                     perception module, the memory module for storing knowledge after learning,
                                     reasoning module using the mechanism of thought, and motion execution module,
                                     among others. This talk introduces recent research outcomes of the RIT
                                     laboratory on MIL (Machine Intelligence Learning) for active knowledge
                                     acquisition and adaptive knowledge application. MIL is applied to an
                                     agent-embedded
                                     robot to build MI based on iOA. This talk focuses on the development of
                                     long-term memory. The long-term memory is developed as an integrated
                                     multi-memory
                                     neural model, in which episodic memory is designed using a Deep DRN
                                     (Developmental Resonance Network) neural model, semantic memory is built using
                                     the 3D
                                     scene graph, and emotional memory is designed based on OICRN (Online
                                     Incremental Classification Resonance Network). Procedural memory is also
                                     designed
                                     using RNNCI (Recurrent Neural Network with Context Information) to store the
                                     trajectories of the manipulator along with context information and then
                                     retrieve them according to the context without any calculations and conscious
                                     thinking. The effectiveness of MIL for the agent-embedded robot is verified
                                     through experiments with a humanoid robot, Mybot, developed in the RIT Lab.
                                     Agent-embedded Mybot is introduced mainly for natural interactions including
                                     VQA (Visual Question Answering) with humans. In the last part, AI World Cup is
                                     introduced, which has three categories, AI Soccer, AI Commentator, and AI

                                         translate the user's intention coded by brain activity measures into a
                                         control signal without using activity of any muscles or peripheral nerves.
                                         These control signals can potentially be employed to substitute motor
                                         capabilities (e.g. brain-controlled prosthetics for amputees or patients
                                         with spinal cord injuries, brain-controlled wheel chair); to help in the

                                             benefits to paralyzed individuals. FNS can produce movement in
                                             paralyzed muscles by the application of electrical stimuli to the
                                             nerves innervating the muscles. The first part of this talk will
                                             describe how smooth muscle movements can be evoked using electrical
                                             stimulation via electrode arrays inserted into peripheral nerves.
                                             Animal experiments demonstrating the feasibility of the method will be
                                             described. The second part of this talk will describe efforts to
                                             decode human motor intent from neural signals. Machine learning
                                             algorithms for accomplishing this objective will be presented. The
